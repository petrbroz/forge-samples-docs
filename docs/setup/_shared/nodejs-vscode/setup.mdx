import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';

import CliSetup from '../cli.mdx';
import GitSetup from '../git.mdx';
import VSCodeSetup from '../vscode.mdx';

## Command-line interface

<CliSetup />

## Source code management

<GitSetup />

## Runtime

We will also need the Node.js _runtime_ to run our code, and the Node.js package manager, _NPM_,
to manage 3rd party dependencies. You can get an installer for your platform on https://nodejs.org/en/download
which will install both.

To make sure the tools are available, try running the following two commands in `bash`:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see something like this:

<Image img={require('./node.png')} />

## Editor

<VSCodeSetup />
