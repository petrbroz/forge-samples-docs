Command-line interface, a _CLI_, is an essential tool when developing modern web applications.
It is often used to initialize new projects, handle their dependencies, or to manage their
source code. Different operating systems have their own options (for example, in Windows there's
the [Command Prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) and [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell),
and Unix-based systems have all sorts of [shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell))
but in our case we're going to be using `bash` which is available _cross-platform_.

- On Unix-based systems, `bash` (or one of its flavors like `zsh`) is most likely available
already, and if not, you can get it from https://www.gnu.org/software/bash.
- On Windows, `bash` will be installed as part of `git`, the source code management tool
discussed in the next section.
