# Simple Viewer

## Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to build a simple Forge application that lets us
upload, translate, and preview 3D designs and 2D drawings.

<ResponsiveVideo src={PreviewUrl} />

We will use the following components of the platform:

- [Authentication](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Data Management](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Model Derivative](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Viewer](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/overview)
